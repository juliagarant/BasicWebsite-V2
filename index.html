       <h3>About Me:</h3>
       <p>My name is Julia Garant. This is my personal website created for COMP2057 that I will refurbish for my personal use in the future. I am a second year honours computer science student at the Univeristy of Windsor in the cooperative education program. I am supposed to start working for Audacia BioScience in may but this may end up being an at home placement type of situation.</p>

       <p>I am Croatian and vey proud of it. I'm still hoping that european cup for soccer may still happen this summer but since COVID-19 my hopes are low. I like books a lot and currently I own 9 new books I have yet to read. I have 2 polaroid original cameras. One is from my mother's cousin, the other is from my great grandmother. If I were to get film for the latter I would want it to be black and white.</p>
