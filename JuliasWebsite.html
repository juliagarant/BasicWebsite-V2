    <h3>Website Attempt 2</h3>
    <p>This is Julia's first attempt at building a website with HTML on her own. The first attempt got attached to her old username on github and she doesn't remember how to fix that. But she learned how to make a button today in class so here's that.</p>

    <button type="button">I Don't Do Anything!</button>

    <p>Here is a drop down menu which list my previous schools.</p>
    <select class="Schools" name="SchoolList" size=1>
      <option value="hughBeaton">Hugh Beaton</option>
      <option value="walkerville">Walkerville</option>
      <option value="uwindsor">University of Windsor</option>
    </select>

  </body>
